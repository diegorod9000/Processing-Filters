# Processing-Filters
This was formerly a school project, but I thought I might add to it when I want to
I made this when I was 15, so it's not omega level code, and Processing is an application I hardly knew and don't really use. 
This application requires access to your files in order to actually use pictures and filters.
Do whatever you want with it. I just thought it was cool.
